# koa-nodejs-boilerplate

A simple, minimal Koa Node.js boilerplate for starting a project.

## Get started

To get started, clone this repository, install all dependencies and start building your services.

To run development, run the following command:

```bash
yarn start:dev
```

To run it as production mode, run the following command:

```bash
yarn start
```

Running the above command will do compilation and output it into `build` folder.

For testing, it uses `jest`. To run the test, run the following command:

```bash
yarn test
```

This boilerplate comes with formatting and linting with bare minimal config. It uses ***prettier*** for formatting, ***typescript-eslint*** for linting and ***husky*** for `pre-commit` hooks.
